I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, with a Master's degree in Statistics acquired from the same university. My research focuses on the intersection of cognitive science, statistics, machine learning, and computational modeling.

## Research Interests

My work centers on understanding complex cognitive processes through advanced statistical and mathematical modeling approaches. I specialize in:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Developing and applying sophisticated temporal models to understand cognitive dynamics
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling**: Leveraging computational methods to discover patterns in cognitive data; Creating robust statistical frameworks for cognitive science research
- **Bayesian Methods**: Using Bayesian approaches for proper accounting of uncertainty in any inference procedure

## Current Research

I'm currently working on several exciting projects that bridge cognitive science and advanced statistical methods:

- **Bayesian Hierarchical Models**: Developing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models for intervention designs in mobile health applications
- **Diffusion Models**: Creating statistical test to assess the sufficiency of diffusion processes in modeling time series data  
- **Model Discovery**: Developing data-driven algorithms to identify plausible generative models for cognitive data

## Academic Background

My academic journey reflects a progression toward interdisciplinary research in cognitive science. I began with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which provided foundational knowledge of human cognition and behavior. Recognizing the need for stronger quantitative skills, I completed a Graduate Diploma in Mathematics, building expertise in formal mathematical reasoning and proof techniques. This led to a Master's degree in Statistics at UC Irvine, where I developed advanced skills in statistical inference, modeling, and data analysis.

Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Cognitive Sciences at UC Irvine, where I synthesize insights from psychology, mathematics, and statistics to tackle complex questions about human cognition. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to bridge theoretical cognitive science with rigorous quantitative methods, enabling me to both understand fundamental cognitive processes and develop sophisticated computational models to test and refine our theories.
